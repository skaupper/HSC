\* degree of reality: \
LT does not have a representation of clock cycles. It handles actions
as self-contained abstract transactions. \
LT therefor represents a low level of reality, but is 10x faster than CC.

CC is a more exact representation of hardware reality. It can simulate
clock cycles. \
Because of that it is much slower, since many more context
switches, etc. have to be handled.
